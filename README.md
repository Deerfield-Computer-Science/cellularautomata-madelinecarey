# APCS-Life
starter code for our spring trimester life project

I have doen the following:
1 - Lifeform is abstrast, with reproduce as an abstract method.  To be alive you must be able to reproduce, but each creature does it differently.
2 - Plant is also abstract
3 - Grass is the only instantiable class

I made the following choices
1 - the world has a creature list
2 - each creature has a world
